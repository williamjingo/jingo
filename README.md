# Portfolio Redesign

My aim is to come up with something more appealing. And since i barely update my personal website wordpress isn't doing me any justice thus for this project I will not setup a backend. If you feel the design is awesome, you can use the code :wink: . This design is inspired by one of the designs on a worpdres theme called [Bridge](https://bridge264.qodeinteractive.com/?_ga=2.76364317.943554280.1603987771-1220441807.1590415155).
