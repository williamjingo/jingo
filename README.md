# Portfolio Redesign

My aim is to come up with something more appealing. And since i barely update my personal website wordpress isn't doing me any justice thus for this project. Please don't forget to reachout. It will be awesome to see how you. This design is inspired by one of the designs on a worpdres theme called [Bridge](https://bridge264.qodeinteractive.com/?_ga=2.76364317.943554280.1603987771-1220441807.1590415155).
